# CS312 Convex Hull

## Project 2 for CS312

### This code includes:
<ul>
        <li>Divide and conquer algorithm to solve the convex hull of a set of points</li>
</ul>

To run the code, run the Proj2GUI.py file. <br>
Any number of points can be entered in a uniform, spherical, or gaussian shape. <br>
Points can also be generated randomly or using a specific seed. <br>
All the points can be cleared. <br>
The solve button can be pushed to run the divide and conquer algorithm to solve the convex hull of the generated points.
